          We implemented a streaming system which can forward live video stream to multiple users from a Phantom4, a drone made by DJI.
          Also, we constructed the streaming server on Raspberry Pi 3 board for high mobility.
          The video stream can be played on any devices if the HTML5 standard web browser is utilized.
