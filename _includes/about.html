    <article>
        <p>
          As of fall 2021, I will be joining the <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/cs">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu">University of Minnesota Twin Cities</a> as a Ph.D. student, fortunately advised by <a href="https://yaoyichi.github.io">Prof. Yao-Yi Chiang</a>.
          <br><br>
          My research interests lie in <em>Spatial Computing</em>, <em>Artificial Intelligence</em>, <em>Natural Language Processing</em>, and <em>Data Science</em>.
          Currently, I mainly focus on designing and building machine learning models from human-centered perspectives, which reflect human needs and further address societal problems. I also validate human-centered machine learning models beyond accuracy by using social science methodologies.
          For more information about my research experience, please refer to my <a href='/Jina_Kim_CV.pdf' style="text-decoration: underline">Curriculum Vitae (PDF)</a>.
          <br><br>
            I obtained my Master's degree in <a href="https://is.skku.edu">Interaction Science</a> from Sungkyunkwan University under <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/eunil">Prof. Eunil Park</a>'s supervision, where I found my passion in conducting interdisciplinary research to solve real-world problems with the support of machine learning models.
            During my Master's, I have completed the non-degree Intensive Artificial Intelligence Program offered by the <a href="https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu">Language Technologies Institute</a> at Carnegie Mellon University.
            Before that I received my Bachelor's degree in <a href="https://www.hansung.ac.kr/Engineering/1176/subview.do">Computer Engineering</a> from Hansung University.
