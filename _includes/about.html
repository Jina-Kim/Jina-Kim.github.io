        <p>
          I am a M. Sc. student in <a href="http://dsl.skku.edu">Data eXperience Lab</a> at Sungkyunkwan University, advised by <a href="http://eunilpark.com">Eunil Park</a>. </br>
          My research area in Human-Computer Interaction and Natural Language Processing focuses on solving real-world problems by finding valuable cues in online services or social media with the support of machine learning models.</br></br>
          The following are the research topics of my interests (click the arrows to see the related publications):
