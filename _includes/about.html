    <article>
        <p>
          I am a M. Sc. student in the <a href="http://is.skku.edu">Department of Interaction Science</a> at Sungkyunkwan University and a member of <a href="http://dsl.skku.edu">Data eXperience Lab</a> advised by Prof. <a href="http://eunilpark.com">Eunil Park</a>.
          My research interests lie at the intersection of <em>natural language processing</em> and <em>human-computer interaction</em>. I am particularly interested in solving real-world problems by finding valuable cues in online services or social media with the support of user-oriented machine learning models.
          Here is my <a href='/Jina_Kim_CV.pdf' style="text-decoration: underline">Curriculum Vitae</a> (PDF; last update: Nov. 2020).
