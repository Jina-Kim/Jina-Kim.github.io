    <h1>About</h1>
    <article>
        <p>
          I am a M. Sc. student in the <a href="http://is.skku.edu">Department of Interaction Science</a> at Sungkyunkwan University and a member of <a href="http://dsl.skku.edu">Data eXperience Lab</a> advised by Prof. <a href="http://eunilpark.com">Eunil Park</a>.
          My research interests lie at the intersection of <em>natural language processing</em> and <em>human-computer interaction</em>.
          <br><br>
          Currently, I mainly focus on designing and building machine learning models from human-centered perspectives, which reflect human needs and further address societal problems. I also attempt to validate human-centered machine learning models beyond accuracy by conducting empirical research methodologies.
          For more information about my research experience, please refer to my <a href='/Jina_Kim_CV.pdf' style="text-decoration: underline">Curriculum Vitae (PDF)</a>.
